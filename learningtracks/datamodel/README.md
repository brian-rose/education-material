# Introduction

Pangeo's take on data models begins here. 

UNIDATA has developed a [common data model](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/v4.6/CDM/index.html) which begins:

> The Common Data Model has three layers, which build on top of each other to add successively richer semantics:
> 
> The data access layer, also know as the syntactic layer, handles data reading and writing.
The coordinate system layer identifies the coordinates of the data arrays. Coordinates are a 
completely general concept for scientific data; we also identify specialized georeferencing 
coordinate systems, which are important to the Earth Science community.
The scientific feature type layer identifies specific types of data, such as grids, radial, 
and point data, adding specialized methods for each kind of data.
