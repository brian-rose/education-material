# Working Group 

## draft purpose

Pangeo is taken as a community coordination effort 'scientists, software, compute infrastructure'. Pangeo education 
has three components thereby: Provide learning paths to research scientists without reinventing wheels, 
provide software publication support for domain scientists, and support curriculum work. There are two 
conceptual artifacts we need to keep in focus: 

## history recent first

### June 17-21 Icesat 2 Hackweek at UW

This event is included in pangeo-ed owing to the wealth of resources that were generated in support of the event.
We need to identify events and resources that become available from events of this sort to include them in the

#### pending follow-on

- (Rob) notes from this call and schedule next call; sprint schedule
- (Rob) Create workspace and deliverables list
- Review related open GitHub issues ()
  - Issue #521 at pangeo-data/pangeo: Glacier model proposal by fmaussion: Follow-up?
  - Issue #440 at pangeo-data/pangeo: Resources for education events: We need an owner for this sub-topic (especially load testing)
  - Issues #411 and #575 require review with follow-up with contributors >> Game Plan

#### [pangeo](http://pangeo.io) pillars

Pangeo is a coordination point between scientists, software, and computing infrastructure 
- Community building: Foster collaboration around open source scientific Python ecosystem for O/A/L/CS
- Domain tool-building: Support development of domain-specific geoscience packages
- Scale-tech building: Improve scalability of these tools, i.e. operate on large datasets

#### summary / directional material 

- Funding: What is pending? What are the opportunities?
  - Example (past): [NSF 19-524](https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?WT.z_pims_id=505342&ods_key=nsf19524)
- "Thanks for the pod... by the way who pays for this?"
  - Schedule: Year 2 (NASA) starts in August; many other gears also turning
  - What are the different ways that pangeo education goes into practice? (list courses, hackweeks, etc)
- Meetings as applied to pangeo-ed
  - Joe report on France meeting?
 - August meeting is pending; we'll need a pangeo-ed agenda
  - What does community building look like? 
    - Bring in more scientists; so what is in it for them?
    - Bring in more developers; so what is in it for them?
    - How does publishing domain code create positive feedback?
- methods
  - "A cascade of education materials" (similar size, smaller quanta composable units)
    - modularized from a 20 minute talk to a 4 hour AGU tutorial to multi-day presence at hackweek 
  - Identify typical user's concerns (teach only what is necessary (best guess))
  - 5 or 6 virtual sprints per year, virtual working space
  - Need a ***testing protocol and testing schedule*** for content
    - Pedagogical issues: Expert blind spot, ***debugging***, time-to-proficiency estimation, what else?
  - Do-and-capture mantra
  - Existing content
    - Damien's OA s/w carpentry (Example review question: 'Does this include `dask`?')
    - Need a review/overhaul of the table presented on the 
[*education-material* repo main page](https://github.com/pangeo-data/education-material)
  - Z2JHub: Good exemplar project model for content
    - Z2Pangeo is nice but too general; suggesting Z2PangeoX where X is the focus
  - Synthesis and Wheel Non-Reinvention
    - Let's consider R-OpenSci and Pi-OpenSci: Peer review s/w publication
    - Z2Pangeo >> Z2JHub???
    - "Focus on building better documentation elsewhere" not just += the pangeo portfolio (tag!)
    - Align with NCAR's ongoing efforts, NCL transition, etc?
