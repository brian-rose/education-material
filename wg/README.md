# Working Group 

## draft purpose

Pangeo is taken as a community coordination effort 'scientists, software, compute infrastructure'. Pangeo education 
has components thereby: Provide learning paths to research scientists without reinventing wheels, 
provide software publication support for domain scientists, support curriculum work... and so on.

# history recent first



## August 21 22 23 pangeo community meeting UW Alder Hall

### Wednesday 4pm Aug 21

- Leading Open Questions on Education
  - "What is unclear or perhaps confusing about pangeo?" as path to "Who and what and how is pangeo teaching?"
  - How should the pangeo Education WG play a role in testing pangeo tech?
  - Does "publications = evidence of pangeo impact" motivate "What should the pangeo team emphasize today?" (Education, *)
  - Value of "Get dataset X wired into pangeo"  
    - Idea is to motivate scientists who use X to migrate to pangeo
    - What is { X } ? 
    - Process to select and import X? 
    - Should Pangeo Ed teach you how to import your own X?


### Thursday Aug 22

- Anthony: Expand on what we have as a starting point; += 
- Robin: Training, using Jupyter notebooks; recreate climate science figures
- Shean: I have to teach now; examples that bridge the gap between small to large scale problems
- Amanda: Only 5 AGU abstracts from pangeo; how do we expand outside this core user grou3 years in!
- Deepak: NCAR, xarray
- Phil Austin: UBC, invested in Jupyter, 12000 accounts; curriculum, 
- Elizabeth Marroon: Teaching data analysis; students
- Lindsey Heagy: Postdoc geophysics Jupyter team: Community around educational resources; hacks; like geosci; not reinvent base level stuff
- Julia, NCAR, interest in EPO from STEM; improving documentation; for ease of use; hosting tutorial for scientists; 200; from all fields; 
- Chris at UCB on Jupyter; two interesting things: How do you define the pattern of shared infrastructure to improve educational outcomes; and using the pangeo stack as highlighting the benefit of the massive resources; so hearts and minds buying into these platforms; and then what are things we could build that facilitate learning. The dask scheduler widget popup being an example. 
- Dax: QC-CUNY. Teaching faculty how to access OOI data using Jupyter; PI on grant on Project Eddy: Data-driven pedagogies. Student pathway from novice to self-sufficient. Data science as core of liberal arts. 


- Curated bootstrapping list seems a consensus concept
  - Jake's book as an example 
  - Core track 3 must-do
  - Pedagogy notebook that does some reverse engineering
- What does it mean to teach pangeo? (AT)
  - It is all these tools; 
  - AA: What are the learning outcomes; take a pedagogical approach
  - Dax: UNIX as context really helps build the context web going into Python  

TASK: Develop a core curriculum for learning pangeo (AA)


Deep: It is stuff for scientists; then pangeo for sysadmins. Ultimately helping... 

DS: If we're trying to teach datascience you don't need a 5TB datacenter. People don't need dask clusters. 

Rob: I think pangeo is a community teaching service...

Lindsey: Who is the first group as target audience? (Scientists!) 

Lindsey: Case history or use-case driven approach. (This is what Joe suggested also) 

TASK: Phil: September teaching a PBL class: Includes all-comers sessions. 15-20 supernumeraries: So this is our first registered project. 

DS: "I am here, here is what I want to do..." decision tree. decision shrub. 

Chris: DAG yml file 

TASK: DAG per Chris, Shean

Chris: How do we generate organized feedback into the organization? 

Lindsey: Get multiple people contributing in a coherent way. The Case History driven approach gets to a framework: Same 7 steps. This suggests

TASK: Lindsey: Common framework for a pangeo case history. Perhaps two kinds: Analysis template and technical template. 







- Your Question Here
- RA suggests a (living dynamic) book with sections for scientists and for administrators
- RA suggeests finding a better communication method than GitHub per "I will never ask a question on GitHub"
- Suggest two concrete elements
  - Create a POET ***project registration***: hermetic units
    - For example: Tire kicking to review resource links
  - Organize thinking in terms of **strategy** versus **tactics**
    - **strategy**: cull through Teaching Tech Together, How Learning Works to build a POET Best Practices Guide
    - **tactics**: Create a set of benchmarks for pangeo running a standard job to answer "How fast/powerful is pangeo?"
- Discussion questions
  - What is pangeo? ---> Who, what, how does pangeo teach? 
  - How should POET test pangeo?
  - Are pubs evidence of impact?...
    - ...how might this motivate POET focus today
  - Data canon
    - Comment on the value of "Get dataset X wired into pangeo" 
      - Will this motivate scientists who use X to migrate to pangeo? 
    - What is the set { X1, X2, X3, ... }? 
    - Process to select and import X? 
    - Should Pangeo Ed teach how to import some X?
- Repo is http://github.com/pangeo-data/education-materials
  - Currently in three parts... pedagogy { cloud, core, git, pod, virtualenv} , wg, README mapping
  - More repos?
- Enrollment: Who is in POET voluntarily? Involuntarily?
- What are target proposals?
  - Who can we work with? e.g. UW SoO/APL + OOI RCA is a good candidate
  - Past: NSF 19-524 
- Lindsey Heagy: Jupyter Community Workshop proposal
- Six month time frame: Milestones
- Designated PM or PMs
- Teaching itinerary
- Recording progress: Importance of, how to
- Whatâ€™s missing here? How do you see improving organization? 
- Review related open GitHub issues ()
  - Issue #521 at pangeo-data/pangeo: Glacier model proposal by fmaussion: Follow-up?
  - Issue #440 at pangeo-data/pangeo: Resources for education events: We need an owner for this sub-topic (especially load testing)
  - Issues #411 and #575 require review with follow-up with contributors >> Game Plan

## June 17-21 Icesat 2 Hackweek at UW

This event is included in pangeo-ed owing to the wealth of resources that were generated in support of the event.
We need to identify events and resources that become available from events of this sort to include them in the

#### [pangeo](http://pangeo.io) pillars

Pangeo is a coordination point between scientists, software, and computing infrastructure 
- Community building: Foster collaboration around open source scientific Python ecosystem for O/A/L/CS
- Domain tool-building: Support development of domain-specific geoscience packages
- Scale-tech building: Improve scalability of these tools, i.e. operate on large datasets

#### summary / directional material 

- Funding: What is pending? What are the opportunities?
  - Example (past): [NSF 19-524](https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?WT.z_pims_id=505342&ods_key=nsf19524)
- "Thanks for the pod... by the way who pays for this?"
  - Schedule: Year 2 (NASA) starts in August; many other gears also turning
  - What are the different ways that pangeo education goes into practice? (list courses, hackweeks, etc)
- Meetings as applied to pangeo-ed
  - Joe report on France meeting?
 - August meeting is pending; we'll need a pangeo-ed agenda
  - What does community building look like? 
    - Bring in more scientists; so what is in it for them?
    - Bring in more developers; so what is in it for them?
    - How does publishing domain code create positive feedback?
- methods
  - "A cascade of education materials" (similar size, smaller quanta composable units)
    - modularized from a 20 minute talk to a 4 hour AGU tutorial to multi-day presence at hackweek 
  - Identify typical user's concerns (teach only what is necessary (best guess))
  - 5 or 6 virtual sprints per year, virtual working space
  - Need a ***testing protocol and testing schedule*** for content
    - Pedagogical issues: Expert blind spot, ***debugging***, time-to-proficiency estimation, what else?
  - Do-and-capture mantra
  - Existing content
    - Damien's OA s/w carpentry (Example review question: 'Does this include `dask`?')
    - Need a review/overhaul of the table presented on the 
[*education-material* repo main page](https://github.com/pangeo-data/education-material)
  - Z2JHub: Good exemplar project model for content
    - Z2Pangeo is nice but too general; suggesting Z2PangeoX where X is the focus
  - Synthesis and Wheel Non-Reinvention
    - Let's consider R-OpenSci and Pi-OpenSci: Peer review s/w publication
    - Z2Pangeo >> Z2JHub???
    - "Focus on building better documentation elsewhere" not just += the pangeo portfolio (tag!)
    - Align with NCAR's ongoing efforts, NCL transition, etc?
