# Pull notes down to here from upper

- em.geosci.xyz as a living documentation entity
  - put code examples out implies you *also* need pointers or explanation of the theory
    - for example to avoid destructive tinkering (and bugs therefrom)
  - so educational content needs to come along with the code
- So... let's talk about a template: 7 Step Process (Setup, Properties, Survey, ...)  
  - The purpose is...
  - The tools that I use are...
- Agreed: Binder is a good litmus test for executable intelligence
- Geophysics Library is a GitHub organization
  - Could model a pangeo repo collection on this; again with the idea of a template
    - Suggests editors: Un-block people on xarray bugs, check Binder, etcetera
- Examples are a great "first contribution" (low barrier; aligned with what you already do)
  - "Here is a slightly more advanced..." going further from the base example
    - Rob wrings his hands about NaN counting in xr.DataArray examples: How hard it is, how unfindable the solution is
    - So this is maybe an open question: Annotating, cross-referencing, prizes! 
    - Question for the tech gang: Auto-inserting? How does Wikipedia do stuff?
- Journal idea (Ryan) joss.readthedocs.io; Checklist; submit package for review; short papers
  - How about one of these for a pangeo case study
    - repo
      - notebooks
      - tests
